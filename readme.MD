# Spring REST API Workshop

This repository contains the code for a workshop that provides a hands-on introduction to REST API development using Spring.

## Overview

This workshop provides an opportunity to familiarize yourself with the concepts and principles of REST API development through practical examples and exercises. It covers key topics such as:

- Understanding the basics of REST APIs
- Setting up a Spring project
- Creating a simple API with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods
- Handling exceptions and returning appropriate HTTP status codes
- Using an in-memory repository for data persistence

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and import the project into your favorite IDE. Ensure that you have JDK 11 installed on your machine.

## Running the Application

Once the application is running, you can access the API at `http://localhost:8080/books`.

## OpenAPI Definition

The API is described using an OpenAPI 3 definition. You can find this definition in the `api.yml` file in the root of the project. You can import this file into a tool like Swagger UI or Postman to visualize the API documentation.
